I want you to help me do a website introduction (same length) similar to the following but adapted to me. Make it sound natural, not full of buzzwords and not generated by ChatGPT.
I'm a frontend engineer with a specialty in web accessibility, focused on building pixel-perfect, intuitive user interfaces. I enjoy working at the intersection of design and engineering, where great user experience meets robust, clean, and scalable code.
Currently, I'm a senior frontend engineer at Klaviyo, where I work on the component library team to help maintain and evolve our design system. In this role, I lead accessibility efforts across components, tooling, and patterns, partnering closely with designers and engineers to ensure accessibility is part of our core architecture.
Previously, I've worked across a wide range of environments, from product studios to startups and large tech companies, including Apple, Starry Internet, and Upstatement. Alongside my professional work, I also created an online video course a few years ago which walks through building a real-world, API-driven application from scratch. These experiences have shaped how I think about building products that are both well-crafted and widely usable.
Outside of work, you can usually find me climbing, playing tennis, hanging out with my wife and two cats, or running around Hyrule searching for Korok seeds.
Details about me:
I am interested in the whole software development lifecycle, both the business aspect and the technical details.
This is supported by my academic journey – I hold a Masters in ICT and a Masters in Knowledge-Based Entrepreneurship
I represented Malta in the prestigious International Olympiad of Informatics. I also won the European pitch deck competition STup!
From a technical point of view, I’m mostly specialised on the .NET ecosystem, database technologies, and also SQL.
I am also a Microsoft Certified AI Engineer.
Currently working as a Senior Lecturer and Vocational Coordinator at MCAST.
Previously worked at Exigy and the University of Malta.
Outside of work I like going to the gym, running, and climbing.

I’m a software engineer and educator with a strong interest in the full software development lifecycle, from technical implementation to the business decisions behind it. I enjoy working on systems where clean architecture, solid data models, and practical constraints come together to support real users and real organisations.

My background is rooted in both academia and industry. I hold a Master’s degree in ICT and a Master’s in Knowledge-Based Entrepreneurship, which shaped how I approach software not just as code, but as a product that needs to be viable, maintainable, and useful. Earlier on, I represented Malta at the International Olympiad of Informatics and later won the European pitch deck competition STup!, experiences that pushed me to think clearly under pressure and communicate technical ideas effectively.

From a technical perspective, I mainly work within the .NET ecosystem, with a strong focus on databases, SQL, and backend systems. I’m also a Microsoft Certified AI Engineer, and I’m particularly interested in how AI and data-driven systems can be integrated responsibly into existing software solutions.

I currently work as a Senior Lecturer and Vocational Coordinator at MCAST, where I teach, design curricula, and work closely with industry to align education with real-world needs. Before this, I worked at Exigy and at the University of Malta, gaining experience across both commercial and academic environments.

Outside of work, I spend most of my time training at the gym, running, or climbing — anything that keeps me moving and clears my head.

I’m a software engineer and educator who enjoys being involved across the full software development lifecycle, from building systems to understanding the business decisions behind them. I’m especially drawn to work where clean architecture, strong data models, and practical constraints come together in service of real users.
